# WeatherApp - Started with Create Next.js 13, Oxylabs, TailwindCSS, Tremore, Typescript and Skeleton

GoogleShoppingApp is an ambitious project that leverages the power of Next.js 13, a robust React framework, to create a dynamic Google Shopping App. The application is designed to efficiently gather external data through the integration of Oxylabs, potentially for web scraping, ensuring up-to-date and comprehensive product information. For an appealing and user-friendly front-end interface, TailwindCSS takes charge of styling and design, while TypeScript provides a strong foundation for codebase reliability, reducing errors and enhancing maintainability. To elevate the user experience during data retrieval, the project also seamlessly incorporates the Skeleton library, creating smooth skeleton loading screens. On the backend, a Next.js-based API has been meticulously crafted to oversee various server-side tasks, such as data management and routing. 

The user-friendly interface offers a search bar and a set of four filters (pages, sorting, minimum price, and maximum price) to allow users to precisely tailor their search results. Users can easily initiate product searches, and the results gracefully showcase vital product details. The left sidebar further enhances customization by offering filter options, ensuring a seamless shopping experience. Clicking on a product opens up a world of comprehensive information, including multiple images, pricing, detailed descriptions, specifications, user reviews, and product highlights, empowering users to make informed purchasing decisions.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
